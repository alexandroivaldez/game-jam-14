# Spreading Seas

This is the codebase for "Spreading Seas", our submission to Pirate Software's [Game Jam 14](https://itch.io/jam/pirate)

In Spreading Seas you play as a pirate who fell down a booby trap after pushing his luck too far! The sea “spreads” beneath you as you try to jump and fight your way out!
